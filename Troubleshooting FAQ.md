<details>
<summary>My Clothes are Clipping</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

There are a few reasons for this.

Female V
- 98 per cent of clothing is fitted to the Custom Fem V body we use.
If some clothes are clipping its because
- You are trying to fit Male V clothes to fem V.
- One Mod may have some clothing that fit and some that clip. As we can't separate some items in a single Mod this is just how it is.
- **Note** at this time not all Phantom Liberty clothing has been refitted for Fem V

Male V
- If you have enabled the Adonis body and clothes are clipping this is because you didn't enable the Refitted Adonis clothing from the optional Mods.
- If you do choose the Adonis body not all clothes are suited to that body so you will find some clip and some dont. This is also out of our control.

<summary>My character has 2 arms 2 different skin colours 2 tattoos 2 Hairstyles etc</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

This can happen if you change your character in the game (mirror or a ripperdoc). This is caused by the **Appearance Change Unlocker** mod this mod is needed to be able to change many things on your character like tattoos ect

<summary>The Camera is locked i cant move up/down</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

This is a bug everyone has had for a long time with the third person mode there is a simple but inconvenient fix. When the camera lock happens 

1) Activate third person with "1"

2) Deactivate third person with "1"

Now the camera should be unlocked

Alternatively you can disable the mod through the in game mod menus. 

1) Select Mods from the main menu 

2) Toggle off third person mode.
