Alternatively you can disable the mod through the in game mod menus. 

1) Select Mods from the main menu

4) Disable the apearance menu mod.

2) Create a character without mods.

3) Save the game after the first mission.

4) Go back to Vortex and Deploy the mods this will enable all the mods. 

5) Start the game and load the save and see if you are able to play.
