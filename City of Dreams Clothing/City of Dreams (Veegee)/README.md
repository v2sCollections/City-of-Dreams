<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! This is a little bit about me and why I started curating mod collections

Back in the 90s, I was a young kid, and I never slowed down for more than two seconds.&#x20;

But this all changed one day when I visited my cousin he had a Super Nintendo!!! and I fell in love, from that moment on I knew gaming was something that called out to me.

So when my parents bought my sister and i our own console (Playstation) I was over the moon, long nights playing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro and Gran Turismo you can't beat these memories.

Skip forward 10 years and games like Red Dead Redemption, GTA Vice City and Need for Speed these games only solidified my love of gaming even more. Like many of us, it gave us a way to escape and let our imagination run wild.

Skip forward to the current day. The time when we can create new experiences in the games that we already love what could be better than this? Modding is really a cool way to add so much more. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods and work as seamlessly as they can.

So join us choombah and come along for the ride.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)This is a large collection I highly recommend purchasing a Nexus premium account even just for 1 month to install the collection it will make installation much easier. You can just cancel the subscription after the installation if you wish.

**Premium Users**: Takes 1 hour + Semi-automatic. You can be AFK.\
**Free Users:** Takes 2 hours + Semi-automatic. You will have to click on download for each mod one by one. **(I recommend you don't attempt this)**
