## NOTES

CDPRs latest patch has introduced some serious issues with stability. You may see issues in the following circumstances:
- Random Crashing
- Major stuttering on INTEL based systems
- Crashes when changing keybinds
These issues are game breaking and will need to be addressed by CDPR so expect another patch soon. Some of the issues have a workaround and quick google search will give you details on how to get around these issues. You may find that some of these issues will occur on certain saves and some saves will be fine.

Simple Menu is still causing stuttering and decreased performance on  some systems. If you are experiencing issues you can disable the Simple Menu in Vortex. The author is aware of this issue and will have an update out soon.
