![](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)Hey, Chooms [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is the [City of Dreams (LITE)](https://) for **Cyberpunk 2077**.

<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! This is a little bit about me and why I started curating mod collections

Back in the 90s, I was a young kid, and I never slowed down for more than two seconds.&#x20;

But this all changed one day when I visited my cousin he had a Super Nintendo!!! and I fell in love, from that moment on I knew gaming was something that called out to me.

So when my parents bought my sister and i our own console (Playstation) I was over the moon, long nights playing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro and Gran Turismo you can't beat these memories.

Skip forward 10 years and games like Red Dead Redemption, GTA Vice City and Need for Speed these games only solidified my love of gaming even more. Like many of us, it gave us a way to escape and let our imagination run wild.

Skip forward to the current day. The time when we can create new experiences in the games that we already love what could be better than this? Modding is really a cool way to add so much more. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods and work as seamlessly as they can.

So join us choombah and come along for the ride.

### ZenoXP:

"Since there isn't any 2024 reviews heres mine:

Soooo I have been constantly streaming Cyberpunk 2077 Nomad run using the Lite version of V2 (mostly because I try to not include anything lewd... Or too lewd) ANYWAY, the collection was very easy to install and has all the great mods already there for me. Not only is the support great but so too are the mods and V2 themselves, I have used other collections but I am yet to redo Starfield mods. In any case, the fact that suggestions are taken onboard but it feels like a community effort.

If I was to rate this out of 10 it would be a 20, I very rarely leave reviews buuuut I figured this year I will change that since it does help game devs/modders, I will also say the fact that I can add more mods to the lite version is also amazing ^^ Just glad to be apart of the community even though I am very quiet and find it hard to communicate but just wanna say thank you for these collections and thank you to the modders who made the game even better than what it is"

![](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/Cyan-Rule.png)

### runme0ver:

"Now that I've finally been able to play around with it and what can I say, it's great, it's a brilliant mod pack. Everything works pretty much seamlessly and the changes are noticeable from the get go.  It's helped me get back into the game and do a whole new playthrough.

Another big portion I think should be mentioned is the community behind this as well, this is probably one of the friendliest and chill servers I've been in on Discord, with the support and testing team being absolute beasts and because of them installing a pack with over 1000 mods couldn't be simpler. You guys are all grand and I hope to see this pack flourish even further into the future."

![](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/Cyan-Rule.png)

### Gen

"I'm new to CP modding, decided to give one of the collections ago as I've spent more time modding the likes of fallout games and Skyrim than I'd like to admit. I settled on City of Dreams (Heavy) as I could see how well supported it was from the documentation and this discord. Install was a breeze the documentation covered every question I had throughout and all completed easily.
It runs far better out of the box than I expected, modded with nearly 1000 mods I'm playing with more frames than I could on CP release on the same system. The game feels so much better! Y'all have done an amazing job with the extra content and eye candy + fixing all the things I didn't like upon release. Great work and a massive thankyou!!! +++"

![](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/Cyan-Rule.png)

### OUSEN:

"I just wanted to take the time to thank you, V2, for the effort you put into creating this modlist and for the incredible gaming experience it has provided. It brings me much closer to the gaming experience I always wanted to have with Vanilla.

People probably don't realize the time and work it takes to find the right functional balance with so many mods.

This modlist offers a unique and customizable gaming experience that has reignited my love for the game. I used to enjoy Night City a lot, and this modlist gives it a refreshing twist.

I also want to mention the work put into writing installation guides and tutorials, which are equally well-crafted with clear and concise explanations.

And one more thing, I haven't mentioned yet, but I also want to highlight the kindness and constant support present on this Discord community. Of course, I'm grateful to V2, but also to Fenrir, who took the time to answer my countless questions in recent days.

With that said, I must go now, I have a city to burn."

![](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/Cyan-Rule.png)

### Fenrir:

"Seeing you succeed like this with a big collection is impressive. But being here with you on your journey just on the side is huge for a little nobody like myself.

I remember when I told you that this collection will grow fast and I see new names here very often, just like I suspected. It‚Äôs an awesome collection with awesome people.

HUGE respect to V2 for giving us his time to fix this collection with 700+ mods to work with so little issues is just AWESOME."

![](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/Cyan-Rule.png)

### Fronky-Bot:

I'd also like to thank V2 for including a couple of my mods in the collection, and quite literally skyrocketing the downloads on them xD

### relentless81:

"Thanks for all  the effort involved to make this collection. I have been enjoying it so far. Its hard sometimes to find collections that work with no issues but this one is top notch!! Great work."

### Jinxy ùì©ùì∏ùì∂ùì´ùì≤ùìÆ Hyperdrive:

"I would like to preface this by first of all thanking the lead behind this collection V2. And all their efforts for maintaining what often can be described as a rather complex and time consuming process, maintaining a collection of mods with a database this large is no easy task, but the dedication and willingness of this individual has made City of Dreams a "Go to" Collection for many, including myself . And with the ease of which the collection has worked as well.

I would also like to thank the staff of this discord for their dedication and expertise in helping solve a plethora of technical issues users can often experience, such is the nature of modding and pc's. Which it itself is no easy feat when you're dealing with potentially hundreds if not thousands of different PC configurations.

Thank you also to the countless modders that without them would not make these collections possible at all. Their countless hours of testing and dedication to hundreds and hundreds of mods, and all for the love and passion of modding and sharing with the community. Making Cyberpunk even more enjoyable for us all.

Thank you to CD Projekt RED for developing this game, and thank you to them for sticking with it and constantly improving the game over the course of time since it's launch, for without them no one us may even be here gathered today.

And also finally a thank you to the discord community for being helpful and pleasant and making the discord a great place for all to gather and talk and about share mods etc."

### Spartandestroyr:

"I‚Äôve only recently stumbled across your cyberpunk collection and before that I never even thought about trying to mod cyberpunk cause it seemed way too complicated but I gave your collection a try and can‚Äôt be happier. I had a few hiccups at first but that was mostly on my end just trying to figure things out but since then I‚Äôve had tons of fun the collection definitely breathed new life into cyberpunk. Now you‚Äôve gone and done it again with starfield! Ive really enjoyed what you have done so far and look forward to seeing this collection grow and blossom into the greatest collection of mods ever assembled. Thank you for all you and everyone else involved so for us. You definitely made modding fun again."

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)This is a large collection I highly recommend purchasing a Nexus premium account even just for 1 month to install the collection it will make installation much easier. You can just cancel the subscription after the installation if you wish.

**Premium Users**: Takes 1 hour + Semi-automatic. You can be AFK with a few Install menus at the end of the installation.\
**Free Users:** Takes 2 hours + Semi-automatic. You will have to click on download for each mod one by one. **(I recommend you don't attempt this)**

> Many fixes to vanilla game bugs.

<details><summary>CLICK FOR MORE DETAILS</summary>
- Fixes damage output of guns when using attachments.
- Fixes all UI elements that get stuck on the screen.
- Fixes River's dialogue in Holo calls it now actually plays the same as talking to him in person.
- Fixes Kerry's holo call Greeting/Farewell now plays properly.
- Fixes mitches jacket with one that¬†fits correctly.
- Fixes textures on Dino Dinovic's chest tattoo.
- Fixes disable the hiding, of the Stamina bar.
- Fixes the issue where the slowest cars had the harshest delivery timers for Muammar's repeatable courier missions.
- Fixes a bug introduced in patch 2.01 that prevents 16 of the skill progression rewards from applying when loading a save made with patch 2.01.
- Fixes a bug when Alcohol is consumed, other buffs can be removed (effect actually removed from the player). Specifically the new bonuses from sleeping and showering.
- Fixes a bug that happens when consuming a Perk or Skill Shard removes a sleeping or showering buff.
- Fixes a bug that with the time label the buff bar only appears when it has more than 30 seconds left in duration. It only checks seconds though, so buffs with more than one minute show the duration from X:59 to X:31 and then disappear from X:30 to X:00. Reappearing and disappearing every 30 seconds.
- The fractional part of Buff/Debuff remaining time in the weapon wheel is incorrect between X.01 and X.09 because it is displayed without the leading zero. (e.g. it displays "17.11", "17.10", "17.9", "17.8", etc.)
- Fixes a bug when loading a save and the player has buffs/debuffs in effect, the gradual fill-in visual effect (in the weapon wheel view) uses the time remaining at load time instead of the max duration of the buff as the denominator when calculating what percent of the icon to fill for the effect.
- Fixes the remaining time displayed on buffs and debuffs next to the health bar and in the weapon wheel which is offset by 15, 30, or 45 minutes (when over a minute long) IF your computer time zone is not a whole number of hours offset from UTC. ***REALLY!*** If you set your time zone to UTC +12:45 (Chatham Islands), the times will be offset by 45 minutes.
- Fixes a bug when you use a Max Doc (inhaler), the icon that appears (for 0.1s) at the top of the screen is wrong. It is usually a duplicate of another recently used icon.
- Fixes Epic Fortified Ankles shows a buff in the status bar while you're hovering, and it was referencing an icon that doesn't exist so it would also show a duplicate of another recently used icon. Fixed to use the "generic buff icon", which actually kind of fits for the hover buff (forward arrows).
- Fixes the armor tooltip in the Cyberware/Ripperdoc menu to be factually correct and show your actual current damage reduction from armor rather than a theoretical maximum.
- Fixes the name of the Encrypted shards group.
- Fixes the missing Butchers Cleaver in the Japantown apartment stash.
- Fixes the missing and/or interrupted segment from Stanley, when leaving the shower after the heist.
- Fixes missing audio for 'regular' segments on N54 News and WNS News, all YBIMB episodes, and one quest/election-related piece.
- Fixes missing WNS TV and Just Ads.
- Removes the Strength skill check from the dumpster in front of Brendan.

## Deceptious Quests

### ![](https://s7.gifyu.com/images/SPvQd.png)Features

> New lore friendly Quests by [deceptious](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/4035601)

<details><summary>NEW QUEST - ONE MORE LIGHT</summary>
![](https://s7.gifyu.com/images/SPvcA.png)**How to "use" the mod?**\
Once 36 hours have passed since both the activate and the text message prerequisite then you will at somepoint recieve a text from Mama Welles, this starts the quest.

**Quest requirements:**\
Attended Jackie's ofrenda, by extension didn't send his body to Vik's
Quest can trigger once at least 36 hours have passed since either the ofrenda and at least 36 hours passed since installing/activating the quest.\
\
**Quest extras:**\
The options this quest unlock continue to be available after completing the quest, you can return and use them at any time.

**Issues/limitations:**\
Currently you can use the 'goodbye' option before any of the others, this feels a little strange, so I might look, in future, into adating this to make it feel a little more natural.
</details>

<details><summary>NEW QUEST - CALIFORNICATION </summary>
![](https://s13.gifyu.com/images/SPvcD.png)**How to "use" the mod?**\
Once 24 hours have passed since both the activate and the text message prerequisite then you will at somepoint recieve a text from Judy, this starts the quest.

**Quest requirements:**\
Romanced Judy, Judy stays in NC, had a positive conversation with Judy's Abuela
Quest can trigger once at least 24 hours have passed since the final romance text messages from Judy, and at least 24 hours after installing the mod.
If you have Hot Fuzz installed too there is a 36 hour delay between this quest and that one, no matter the order you get them.\
\
**Quest extras:**\
You can fail this quest! If you try to leave the quest area it will fail, but it does give you plenty of warning!
This quest has an optional step, I was experimenting with new features on this one vs Hot Fuzz.

**Issues/limitations:**\
If you drive to the location, when you wait it will despawn your vehicle(s). I couldn't get reparking it to work yet, but this was a cleaner option than the potential clipping mess...
The ambient audio seems to cut out abruptly when sitting down, I think this is the music mix kicking in, not sure i can do anything about this.
Brief "shower" sound at the end of the quest: This is an issue from Judy Romanced Enhanced, if I can fix it it will be part of that mod not this one.

<details><summary>NEW QUEST - HOTT FUZZ</summary>

Quest can trigger once at least 24 hours have passed since the final romance text messages from Judy, and at least 24 hours after installing the mod.
If you have Californication installed too there is a 36 hour delay between this quest and that one, no matter the order you get them.

**Issues/limitations:**\
A loot pickup on the bed may be visible on arrival to the room. It's not real, I'm still looking in how to hide it properly.

## New Game Plus

![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SyjkW.png)[New Game Plus - Native](https://) by [notalphanine](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/38499075)

## &#x20;Features

> Play through **Cyberpunk 2077** again with top-tier gear. Start a new game from the beginning of V's story or fast-track to your first meeting with Johnny Silverhand.

<details><summary>CLICK FOR MORE DETAILS</summary>
### [What does New Game+transfer?](https://)

- Your **progression data** (level, street cred, perk points, attribute values, attribute points, Relic points, proficiencies, cyberware capacity shards...) (Note: your level will be capped to 50 in transfer, 40 if you don't own Phantom Liberty - this is to add some progression within NG+)
- Your **inventory and stash**(the only items that aren't transferred are the ones invisible in UI, the GOG reward items and Skippy/Dying Night)\*\* **and unequipped** cyberware\*\*(some cyberware will be unequipped at the start due to potential concerns with the player's cyberware capacity, your **upgraded cyberware stats shards are preserved**)
- **Garage**, apart from a few vehicles (Jackie's Arch, Demiurge, Hoon)
- Your **wardrobe's clothing store**
- Your **EquipmentEx outfits**

### [How do I know that I am eligible for New Game+?](https://)

Saves are eligible for **New Game+** progression transfer if they are made on Patch 2.0 and up and:\\

- Are Point Of No Return saves or
- Have Hanako waiting for you at Embers or
- Have Reed waiting for you at Misty's Esoterica

Saves are **filtered by playthrough**, and only the latest save per playthrough gets shown on the save selection screen.\
\
You will know when you have **New Game+** eligible when you have the "**New Game+**" menu button on your screen.\
\
If your only requirement-meeting saves are from Patch 1.63 or older, then simply continue into a game from one of those saves, make any kind of save again, then go back to the main menu. Once you are in the main menu, **New Game+** will have found the new save and have the button displayed for you.

### [Restrictions](https://)

- You need New Game+installed to load saves from games started using New Game+. This is a hard requirement and will not be lifted.
- Following from this, New Game+saves will NOT run on consoles using crossplay.
- Saves from consoles are not supported for progression transfer due to differences between console and PC saves, you will have to resave again on PC.
- The mod will not keep the player's selected perks due to the possibility of changing attributes during character creation. Perk Points, along with Relic Points (in case ofPhantom Liberty), will be refunded to the player.\
  \
  **Known issues**\
  \- In Love Like Fire, the Relic Malfunction sound may be playing during the flashback. I do not believe this is a major bug, as most of the sound is drowned out by the combat and the music. It will be fixed whenever it will be fixed, there's no ETA.\
  \- Some bugs may happen with the transfer of Dying Night from pre-2.0 saves, resulting in The Gun being uncompletable. This should not be a problem in the release version of the mod.

### [FAQ](https://)

- Q: Can I change my gender/life path from the original save going into New Game+?
- A: Yes.

\<!---->

- Q: Can I disable various bad guys attacking me while I'm doing something?
- A: Yes, via the mod settings menu.

\<!---->

- Q: Can I have the Post-Heist start's start point a little later? I don't like all the cutscenes...
- A: The mod settings menu has a setting for that. You can have the Post-Heist start begin from Misty rolling you into your Megabuilding H10 apartment.

\<!---->

- Q: In Post-Heist start, when Misty rolls you into your apartment, the game is stuck on a black screen with a looping sound...
- A: You may have a quest mod that outputs a tutorial when you enter the apartment. Try spamming C.

[Drive an Aerial Vehicle(AV and Helicopter)](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13842) by [tidusMD](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/112181303)

### Features

> This mod introduces the ability to operate an AV and Helicopter. It adds a new layer of gameplay, allowing players to fly around Night City and use an auto-pilot feature for transportation. The AV can be purchased and summoned like any regular vehicle, offering a fresh perspective and a novel way to explore the Night City.

<details><summary>CLICK FOR MORE DETAILS</summary>
**User Guide**\
There are two control methods. You can switch between them from the ‚ÄòControl‚Äô tab in the CET menu.
The following are the instructions for operating the AV (when the hints are enabled in the settings and displayed on the HUD):\
**\[Spinner]**

- Press the W key to accelerate forward, and the S key to accelerate backward. (For controllers, use the up and down on the left stick)
- Use the D key to rotate to the right, and the A key\*\* \*\*to rotate to the left. (For controllers, use the left and right on the left stick)
- Hold the left mouse button to ascend, and the right mouse button\*\* \*\*to descend. (For controllers, use the R and L triggers)\\

**\[Helicopter]**\\

- Press the keys "W","S","D","A" (or use the left stick on the controller) to tilt the AV in the corresponding direction and move.
- Use the keys "Q","E" (or the shoulder buttons on the controller) to rotate the AV horizontally.
- Hold down the left mouse button (or press the A button on the controller) to increase the lift of the AV. Release the button to decrease lift naturally.
- Press the spacebar (or the right trigger on the controller) to maintain altitude while moving forward. When you press this button once, the altitude hold mode will remain active even if you release the button. If you want to change the altitude, press the left mouse button (or press the A button on the controller).\\

**\[Common]Change Key From v1.5.0**

- Press the key "G" (or the left d-pad on the controller) to open or close the door.
- Press the key "V" (or the down d-pad on the controller) to change perspective.
- Hold the key "R" (or the down d-pad on the controller) to play radio or change ths station.\\

**\[Auto Pilot Mode]**\\

- press the key "T" (or the right d-pad on the controller) to switch to autopilot mode. This will automatically drive to the location of the pin set by the user on the map.
- You can also use the CET menu to register a location where you have arrived in the past using autopilot as a favorite and set that place as your destination. This is only valid when you have not placed a map pin.
- The speed of the autopilot can be adjusted in three stages. Changes will be reflected the next time the vehicle is generated.\\

**\[CET Bindings]**\
By configuring the CET Binding settings, you can perform the following operations.\\

- Crystal dome ON/OFF (limited to Excalibur and Manticore)\\

Keep in mind that the AV has inertia, so it won‚Äôt turn immediately. If you get stuck on something, please keep pressing the accelerator button. The AV will take evasive action.
