### OUSEN:

"I just wanted to take the time to thank you, V2, for the effort you put into creating this modlist and for the incredible gaming experience it has provided. It brings me much closer to the gaming experience I always wanted to have with Vanilla.

People probably don't realize the time and work it takes to find the right functional balance with so many mods.

This modlist offers a unique and customizable gaming experience that has reignited my love for the game. I used to enjoy Night City a lot, and this modlist gives it a refreshing twist.

I also want to mention the work put into writing installation guides and tutorials, which are equally well-crafted with clear and concise explanations.

And one more thing, I haven't mentioned yet, but I also want to highlight the kindness and constant support present on this Discord community. Of course, I'm grateful to V2, but also to Fenrir, who took the time to answer my countless questions in recent days.

With that said, I must go now, I have a city to burn."

### Fenrir:

"Seeing you succeed like this with a big collection is impressive. But being here with you on your journey just on the side is huge for a little nobody like myself.

I remember when I told you that this collection will grow fast and I see new names here very often, just like I suspected. It’s an awesome collection with awesome people.

HUGE respect to V2 for giving us his time to fix this collection with 700+ mods to work with so little issues is just AWESOME."

### Jinxy 𝓩𝓸𝓶𝓫𝓲𝓮 Hyperdrive:

"I would like to preface this by first of all thanking the lead behind this collection V2. And all their efforts for maintaining what often can be described as a rather complex and time consuming process, maintaining a collection of mods with a database this large is no easy task, but the dedication and willingness of this individual has made City of Dreams a "Go to" Collection for many, including myself . And with the ease of which the collection has worked as well.

I would also like to thank the staff of this discord for their dedication and expertise in helping solve a plethora of technical issues users can often experience, such is the nature of modding and pc's. Which it itself is no easy feat when you're dealing with potentially hundreds if not thousands of different PC configurations.

Thank you also to the countless modders that without them would not make these collections possible at all. Their countless hours of testing and dedication to hundreds and hundreds of mods, and all for the love and passion of modding and sharing with the community. Making Cyberpunk even more enjoyable for us all.

Thank you to CD Projekt RED for developing this game, and thank you to them for sticking with it and constantly improving the game over the course of time since it's launch, for without them no one us may even be here gathered today.

And also finally a thank you to the discord community for being helpful and pleasant and making the discord a great place for all to gather and talk and about share mods etc."

This is a large collection I recommend purchasing a Nexus premium account even just for 1 month to install the collection it will make installation much easier. And you can just cancel the subscription after the installation if you wish.

**Premium Users**: Takes 1.5 hours + Semi-automatic. You can be AFK with a few Install menus at the end of the installation.\
**Free Users:** Takes 2.5 to 3 hours + Semi-automatic. You will have to click on download for each mod one by one.

### Features

> Allows the player to control the character midair while jumping and double jumping (no different types of leg cyberware supported yet). Adds "wallbouncing/walljumping" inspired by an Apex Legends movement mechanic, which means you can bounce back from a wall when directly looking at it and pressing/holding jump. Made the player slow down in the air if not pressing any movement keys to allow for a lot more precise landing than vanilla. Controller is supported and most things are configurable with [Native Settings UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518)

**How to wall jump**

Wall jumping is triggered when the player is:

1. in the air.
2. looking directly forward at a solid surface that is right in front of the player character.
3. holding down the jump button.

- You need to stop moving forward (let go of the forward key or pull back the analog stick) in order to not go back directly at the wall right after the wall jump.
- You can instantly redirect your wall jump in a backward diagonal left/right direction if you press the left or right movement keys at the moment you wall jump.
- Redirecting the wall bounce direction is possible in general with camera positioning and movement keys, similar to the regular midair movement (its strength is boosted to feel more fluid, but it needs some practice to get the hang of it)

**Walljump usage with a **jump all double** jump:**

- If you don't want to double jump at all, \*\*HOLD \*\*the jump button from the ground to only wall jump.
- If you want to double jump after a wall jump, \*\*HOLD \*\*the jump button from the ground -> wall jump -> release the jump key -> press the jump key again to double jump.
- Double jump will be used up when pressing instead of holding the jump key, but I compensated this by increasing the jump height, so it becomes a feature instead of a bug.\\

**How to control midair movement:**

- As a general rule of thumb, you'll be able to push the character in the direction you are pressing the movement keys and turning the camera affects the direction too.
- After jumping hold Forward + Left/Right and turn your mouse in the same direction to make a wide arc.
- After jumping let go of Forward and hold Left/Right and turn your mouse in the same direction to make a sharper turn.
- With source engine movement you can also tap strafe, which is rapidly pressing the movement keys in the air to drastically change your movement direction.
- If you let go of every movement key (WASD) the character will start slowing down, you can also slow down faster by moving backwards but keep in mind the character will actually start moving backwards once the forward momentum is gone.

### Time Dilation Overhaul

[Time Dilation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4931) by [TeslaCoiled](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/3534466)

### Features

> Overhauls Time Dilation in Cyberpunk to provide a more challenging and rewarding experience. Featuring all new abilities such as Katana Reflect, Vehicle Time Dilation, and Teleportation!

<details><summary>CLICK FOR MORE DETAILS</summary>
This mod was created to address what felt like some fundamentally broken aspects of the way Time Dilation is handled within Cyberpunk 2077. This mod touches nearly every aspect of Time Dilation, and features 344 configurable variables to control it all!\
\
This mod primarily:\\

- Provides some minor bug fixes and quality of life options
- Changes the way NPCs behave in time dilation
- Changes how Scanning/Quickhack Time Dilation works
- Completely reworks the Sandevistan Operating System **(including versions that make ranged weapons viable, allow Katana bullet reflection, activate time dilation in vehicles, and allow the player to teleport)**

For the purposes of this mod page, the default values will be utilized in discussing the various changes. Generally speaking, this mod aims to make Time Dilation gameplay more challenging and rewarding than the vanilla implementation. The 344 configurable variables in a Native Settings UI mod menu allow you to change and tweak the mod to your heart’s content.

You can find the new sandevistans added by [Time Dilation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4931) at the following locations.

- Zetatech Mk 4 - Arroyo Ripperdock
- Militech Mk 4 - Kabuki Ripperdock
